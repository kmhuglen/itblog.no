The solution is not new, but the solution has not been packaged before. The customizations made by the solution can be done by anyone that takes the time to build them. This solution is portable and should work in any Service Manager environment. This solution is meant for IT pros that are not familiar with Service Manager development tools and that just want to drop in a management pack to resolve this problem.

        Before altering BIOS, drives, partitions and volumes</strong>

If you alter the BIOS, drives partition and volumes protected by Bitlocker the result will in most cases be that the OS is asking for the Recovery Password before boot. By suspending the Bitlocker on all drives before alter any bios or volumes; you’ll save yourself a lot of hassle.

I used that for a couple of days and reverted back, as I did not get any of the new feature in the user interface that Windows 8 introduces. With MetroController from WinAero.com (a small and simple tool) lets you disable just the Metro start-menu, but keeps the new Ribbon Explorer.
