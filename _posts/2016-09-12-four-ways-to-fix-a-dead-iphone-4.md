Are you a sad iPad or iPhoneÂ owner? Maybe this can get you back in mood ðŸ™‚ Found an excellent article at Know Your CellÂ about [How To Fix A Dead iPhone][1]

Option 2 did the job for me:

> Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button simultaneously for at least 10 seconds. The red slider may appear and the screen may dim but don&#8217;t release the two buttons until the Apple logo appears

It&#8217;s the second time now that the iPhone just dies, nothing happens when I press The Button. The first time it just started working again after a couple of hours, without me doing anything. But this time I did notÂ have the time to wait, so after a short google search I found theÂ article at Know Your Cell. Thanks.
