My previous post Disable the Windows 8 Metro look, disable all of the new user interface giving you almost the same user interface as Windows 7. I used that for a couple of days and reverted back, as I did not get any of the new feature in the user interface that Windows 8 introduces. With MetroController from WinAero.com (a small and simple tool) lets you disable just the Metro start-menu, but keeps the new Ribbon Explorer.
