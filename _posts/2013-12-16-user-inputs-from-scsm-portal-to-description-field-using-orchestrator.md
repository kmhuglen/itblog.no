There are several blog posts already about how to get the User Input from a Service Request or Incident Request formatted and put into the description field.

But I wanted to use Orchestrator so I could make changes without having to recompile the solution every time. I used some of the script published by [Kurt Van Hoecke at Authoring Friday][1] in my orchestrator version.

Another blog: Solution to clean User Input from Service Manager Portal and commit it to the Action LogÂ @ Coretech Blog

**Orchestrator Monitor Runbooks**

Orchestrator is set up with a generic Service Manager monitor for new Incident Request and Service Request , and using the Link Include Filter, I send all new incident and service request with source Portal to the Runbook.

**UserInput to Description Runbook**

1. I take the ID of the Work Item as an input in the Initialize Data activity.
2. Link filter WorkItemID starts with IR or SR.
3. In the Get Incident/Service Request activity I have a filter ID equals WorkItemID from Initialize Data.
4. The UserInput from the Get Get Incident/Service Request activity are used in the script in Get IR/SR UserInput.
5. And finaly I update the IR/SR description field.

Here I use the Execute PS Secript activity from the [Orchestrator Integration Pack for PowerShell Script Execution 1.2][6] for my Get IR/SR UserInput activities, but the default Run .Net Script Activity would also work just fine.
