This solution provides a drop-in solution to get a customized &#8220;**Area**&#8221; list in **Service Requests** so that you don&#8217;t have to learn how to build the customization yourself. The solution is not new, but the solution has not been packaged before. The customizations made by the solution can be done by anyone that takes the time to build them. This solution is portable and should work in any Service Manager environment. This solution is meant for IT pros that are not familiar with Service Manager development tools and that just want to drop in a management pack to resolve this problem.

The solution is created by Buchatech, and can be download from the TechNet Gallery
