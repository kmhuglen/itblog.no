I stumbleupon an article, [Windows XP Favourites Redirection – ADMX files][1], at [RAMBLINGS OF AN IT CONSULTANT][2].

It describes how to enable folder redirection (similar to what was introduced by Vista) for the Favorites folder on Windows XP, by using custom group policy ADM/ADMX. I have not tried it out my self, but it seem rather straight forward.

Can come in handy when moving users between Windows XP and Vista/Windows 7.
