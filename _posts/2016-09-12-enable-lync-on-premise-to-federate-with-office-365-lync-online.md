By default the On-Premise Lync installation is not enabled for communication with Office 365 Lync Online, even if you&#8217;ve enabled open federation on both installations.

Tom Arbuthnot has a great post (How to enable Lync On-Premise to Federate with Office365 Lync Online) on how to solve this issue, and I would recommend everyone with an On-premise Lync installation to follow the instructions.
