1. Logon on to  and create a custom module.
  
2. Download the TeamViewer_Host-**idcXXXXXXX**.msi (or just rename the one you already have, remember to add **-idc** before your 7 character ConfigurationID).
  
3. Install the TeamViewer Host on a computer; configure it the way you want, and export the **TeamViewer_Settings.reg**.
  
4. Run the following PowerShell script on a computer With the Active Directory PowerShell Module installed and With administrative rights to Your domain. (Replace the XXXXXXX With Your ConfigurationID)

`.\TrustConfigID.ps1 -Add XXXXXXX -Name TeamViewer -Path "CN=System,DC=yourdomain,DC=com"`

5. Put both the **TeamViewer_Host-idcXXXXXXX.msi** and **TeamViewer_Settings.reg** in the same folder/share.
  
6. Run the following commands to silently install, remove desktop shortcut and hide the dialog at logon:

`REG ADD HKCU\Software\TeamViewer /v HostInfoDialog /t REG_DWORD /d 0
REG ADD HKU\.DEFAULT\Software\TeamViewer /v HostInfoDialog /t REG_DWORD /d 0
start /wait MSIEXEC.EXE /i "TeamViewer_Host-idcmbwnmzt.msi" /qn
del "%Public%\Desktop\TeamViewer*.lnk"`
